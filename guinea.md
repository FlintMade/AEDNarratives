## Current Issues

Ziama Strict Nature Reserve is believed to hold Guinea’s single remaining elephant population. The area is under pressure from growing human populations and increased cultivation at the edges of the reserve. Crop raiding by elephants is a continuing problem [(Ministère de l’Agriculture, de l’Elévage, de l’Environnement, des Eaux et des Forêts, 2007)](/references#m). Law enforcement improved in 2015 with support from Fauna and Flora International [(Mollon, pers. comm., 2016)](/references#m).

Ouré Kaba, a population referred to in the AESR 2007, is recorded as lost.

Guinea published a national elephant management strategy in 2007 [(Ministère de l’Agriculture, de l’Elévage, de l’Environnement, des Eaux et des Forêts, 2007)](/references#m).

## Numbers and Distribution

There have been no surveys carried out in Guinea in the last 10 years to the standards required for generating an estimate. There may be 64 to 138 elephants in areas not systematically surveyed. These guesses likely represent a minimum number, and actual numbers could be higher than those reported. Together, this estimate and guess apply to 1,207 km², which is 78% of the estimated known and possible elephant range. There remains an additional 22% of the estimated elephant range for which no elephant population estimates are available.

The Wild Chimpanzee Foundation (WCF) surveyed a number of forest areas in Guinea between May 2009 and May 2011. Signs of elephants were only observed in Ziama Strict Nature Reserve. Elephants had long been absent from Ziama Strict Nature Reserve and surrounding forests until 1996, when it is thought they arrived from neighbouring Liberia [(Sagnah & Sagnah, 2000)](/references#s). It is believed that movement across this border continues, and it is possible that these elephants also move as far as Côte d’Ivoire [(Mollon, pers. comm., 2016)](/references#m). The absence of elephant signs in the Mt. Nimba area, however, during the WCF surveys suggest that these movements, if they occur, are intermittent. 

The **dung count** of Ziama SNR gave a new estimate of 64-138 [(Wild Chimpanzee Foundation, 2012)](/references#w). This replaces an estimate of 214 ± 79 from 2004 [(Barnes & Nandjui, 2005)](/references#b). However, based on the distribution of elephants and the abundance of their signs, Fauna & Flora International staff members working in the area feel that this estimate is too low and there are probably still around 200 elephants in the area [(Mollon, pers. comm., 2016)](/references#m). Elephants are found throughout the reserve, although at lower densities around the two settlements in the east, and the hilly country in the west [(Wild Chimpanzee Foundation, 2012)](/references#w). Therefore the range has been changed to include the whole reserve. There is recent evidence of elephants moving from Ziama SNR towards the Simandou range, about 50 km north-east, with a small group possibly resident around the Pic de Fon [(Mollon, pers. comm., 2016)](/references#m).

The WCF found no signs of elephants in the Ouré Kaba area, on the border with Sierra Leone. Therefore this area has been removed from the range map, and recorded as a **lost population**. In the AESR 2007, the area of Sansalé in the northwest, on the border with Guinea Bissau, had an estimate of zero [(Sagnah, pers. comm., 1998)](/references#s) and was recorded as a lost population. The corresponding area of **doubtful range** has now been removed. There has been no information from the Corubal-Dulombi cross-border population in more than 10 years, so this has been changed to **possible range**.
