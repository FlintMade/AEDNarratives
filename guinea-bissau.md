## Current Issues

Only a handful of elephants were reported from Guinea Bissau more than ten years ago [(Brugière et al., 2006)](/references#b). It is believed that a small number may still survive [(Brugière, pers. comm., 2016; Goedmakers, pers. comm., 2016)](/references#b) but their future is very uncertain. 

Guinea-Bissau published its national elephant action plan in 2000 [(Ministère de l’Agriculture et Développement Rurale, 2000)](/references#m).

## Numbers and Distribution

There have been no surveys carried out in Guinea Bissau in the last ten years to the standards required for generating an estimate. There may be seven elephants in areas not systematically surveyed. This guess likely represents a minimum number, and actual numbers could be higher. This number applies to 1,346 km², which is the entirety of the estimated known and possible elephant range. 

There have been no changes to numbers or distribution since the AESR 2007. A study of elephant distribution based on interviews with hunters concluded that only a small elephant population remained in the south-east of Guinea Bissau [(Brugière et al., 2006)](/references#b) with a minimum of seven elephants in the Corubal-Dulombi area, and that no more than 20 elephants remained in the country. Given the absence of recent information, the range area has been downgraded to **possible range**, while the estimate has been degraded due to age.

In 2006 it was believed that elephants from the Corubal Dulombi area still moved seasonally across the border to Guinea [(Brugière et al., 2006)](/references#b), but there is no recent information on whether this is still the case.
